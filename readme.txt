This plugin adds the VenoBox Responsive Lightbox to links to display Vimeo and YouTube videos, images, galleries, iframe, inline content in a lightbox.


== Description ==

This plugin adds the VenoBox Responsive Lightbox to links, displaying YouTube and Vimeo videos, images, galleries, iframe, Google Maps or other inline content in a responsive lightbox display.

Plugin option to open all linked images and galleries in WordPress in Lightbox mode.

The big difference compared to many others plugins like this is that VenoBox calculates the max width of the image displayed and preserves its height if is taller than the window (so in small devices you can scroll down the content, avoiding vertical microscopic resized images).

Option to disable Beaver Builder lightbox plugin.


== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin:

1. Upload the `venobox-lightbox` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Options are in Settings => Venobox Lightbox


== Usage ==

Comprehensive usage is documented in the WP Admin > Dashboard > Settings > VenoBox Lightbox.

There are manual markup instructions for videos and iframes and automated options for images.

Ability to enable/disable VenoBox gallery for images on a per post/page/custom post type level.

Demo containing images and videos: http://themes.wpbeaches.com/venobox/
